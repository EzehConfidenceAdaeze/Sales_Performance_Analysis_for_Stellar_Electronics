*	Order and Quantity Decline: The number of orders and quantities sold dropped by 26% in 2023. This indicates that fewer products were sold and ordered, suggesting a decrease in demand or market activity.

**Product Performance:**
*	In 2023, Tablets and Headphones were the top-selling products.
* In 2022, Headphones and Smartphones were the top-selling products.

## RECOMMENDATIONS:  

- Reevaluate marketing and promotional strategies or explore alternative methods to boost their effectiveness.
- Focus on optimizing operations and staffing for peak times (e.g., 6:00 PM) and days (e.g., Friday). Conversely, develop strategies to boost performance on lower-performing days like Tuesday.
- Since the apparel store outperforms others, understanding and leveraging its successful strategies could be beneficial. Replicate its foot traffic-driving techniques across other stores.
